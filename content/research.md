  This paper provides the first causal evidence that entrepreneurial activity diffuses through neighborhood ties. I exploit residential moves in North Carolina to study whether the arrival of an entrepreneurial neighbor increases business formation among incumbent residents. The analysis merges statewide business registrations, voter files, and property transaction data into a panel that links individuals to their neighbors and entrepreneurial outcomes over nearly two decades. Using a nearest-neighbor design with highly granular fixed effects, I find that exposure to entrepreneurial neighbors raises the probability of business entry by 4–9 percent within five years. Spillovers are stronger when incumbents and newcomers share gender, but not when they share race, suggesting that cross-racial exposure may help lower barriers to entrepreneurship for Black residents. Most effects occur in unincorporated, lower-cost businesses, while exposure to high-quality entrepreneurs is linked to a higher likelihood of starting incorporated firms. Finally, spillover intensity declines sharply with physical distance, with effects concentrated among immediate neighbors. These findings show that localized social interactions are an important channel through which entrepreneurship and economic opportunity spread.

  A three-factor no-arbitrage stochastic commodity pricing model is calibrated to copper using analysts' predictions provided by Bloomberg's Commodity Price Forecast and futures prices from the COMEX and LME metals exchanges. The model generates futures prices, expected spot prices and time-varying risk premiums for different maturities. Results show that between October 2010 and June 2018 both exchanges exhibit a positive average risk premium for each maturity. The risk premiums for both exchanges are also shown to be stochastic, with short maturities having higher average values and greater volatility. In addition, the futures prices of COMEX values were greater than those LME with a mean difference of 0.477% and the LME exhibits higher averages values than COMEX for expected spot prices and risk premiums, with differences of 0.438% and 0.354%, respectively. As for risk premium volatility, the estimate for COMEX is 0.993% greater than that for LME. Statistically significant evidence is also given for the cointegration of the two markets. An empirical analysis shows that the main determinants of the variation in copper risk premiums are variations in COMEX inventories, hedging pressure, the default premium, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index and the return on the NASDAQ Emerging Market Index. Finally, the approach is used for estimating expected copper spot prices, thus making it a useful tool for practitioners and policy makers who use expected copper prices as the basis for their investment and risk-management decisions.
